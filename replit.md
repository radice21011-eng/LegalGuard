# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The client uses a modern React stack with TypeScript, built using Vite for fast development and optimized builds. The architecture follows a component-based design with:

- **UI Framework**: Radix UI components with Tailwind CSS for styling using the "new-york" style from shadcn/ui
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for theming, supporting both dark and light modes
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation across all components and utilities

## Backend Architecture
The server uses Express.js with TypeScript in ESM module format, providing a RESTful API structure:

- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect for type-safe database operations
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL-based session storage using connect-pg-simple
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints for projects, legal documents, GDPR requests, and copyright violations
- **Middleware Stack**: Custom security, copyright protection, and GDPR compliance middleware

## Data Storage Solutions
